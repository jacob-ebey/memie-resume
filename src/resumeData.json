    "bio":"My undergraduate hard science courses with labs and experiences working in the labolatory setting have assured me to pursue career in research field to help developing more effective techniques to eliminating diseases and provide improved treatments for patients in the future. I am particularly passionate about how immune system works and fights off infections, as well as, how molecules (hormones, proteins, lipids, drugs, and etc) interact with other molecules such as receptors and communicate with our body to activate specific pathway and exhibit specific function. I am interested in learning/exploring new techniques and expanding my scientific background and hoping that one day, my knowledge will be able to save people in the future.",
